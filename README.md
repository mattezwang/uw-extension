This is a Google Extension WIP; When completed, it should utilize Madgrades and RateMyProfessor APIs to show students the average rating of the professor and the average GPA. More features to come!


TODO: 

issue with the prof rating thing, it only shows up once and if you back out and click on "see sections" again it doesnt work, and if you go to other classes now it doesnt alert for more than one professor
